the-tale-of-bad-mice,"ONCE upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"IT belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"THERE were two red lobsters, and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,ONE morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,Tom Thumb was a mouse.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"A MINUTE afterwards Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,THE doll's house stood at the other side of the fireplace.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearth-rug.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,They pushed the front door--it was not fast.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,TOM THUMB and Hunca Munca went up-stairs and peeped into the dining-room.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,Then they squeaked with joy!
the-tale-of-bad-mice,Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table!
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!"
the-tale-of-bad-mice,TOM THUMB set to work at once to carve the ham.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"""It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca."""
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"HUNCA MUNCA stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"""It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,"" said Hunca Munca."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"THE ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"""Let it alone,"" said Tom Thumb; ""give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"""
the-tale-of-bad-mice,HUNCA MUNCA tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash!"
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!"
the-tale-of-bad-mice,THEN there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears, and the oranges."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,TOM THUMB went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top--there was no soot.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"WHILE Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labeled ""Rice,"" ""Coffee"" ""Sago""; but when she turned them upside down there was nothing inside except red and blue beads."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,THEN those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb!
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top-floor window."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather-bed."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,WITH Tom Thumb's assistance she carried the bolster down-stairs and across the hearth-rug.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"THEN Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a bookcase, a bird-cage, and several small odds and ends."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,The bookcase and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"HUNCA MUNCA left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"HUNCA MUNCA was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,WHAT a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared, and Jane leaned against the kitchen dresser and smiled; but neither of them made any remark."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,THE bookcase and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box; but Hunca Munca has got the cradle and some of Lucinda's clothes.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"SHE also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"THE little girl that the doll's house belonged to said: ""I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"""
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"BUT the nurse said: ""I will set a mouse-trap!"""
the-tale-of-bad-mice,SO that is the story of the two Bad Mice.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,"But they were not so very, very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke."
the-tale-of-bad-mice,He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.
the-tale-of-bad-mice,AND very early every morning--before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!
