the-roly-poly-pudding,"ONCE upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!"
the-roly-poly-pudding,On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night--especially cheese and bacon."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out."
the-roly-poly-pudding,They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They patted it with their little soft paws--""Shall we make dear little muffins?"" said Mittens to Moppet."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--""Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha, shedding tears."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,She wiped her eyes with an apron.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""They have both got out of the cup-board!"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Yes, it is infested with rats,"" said Tabitha tearfully, ""I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,"" said Tabitha."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.
the-roly-poly-pudding,They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
the-roly-poly-pudding,But there was nothing to be seen.
the-roly-poly-pudding,They returned to the kitchen.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Here's one of your kittens at least,"" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel."
the-roly-poly-pudding,They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
the-roly-poly-pudding,She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Oh! Mother, Mother,"" said Moppet, ""there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!"
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Which way did she go, Moppet?"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search."
the-roly-poly-pudding,They went into the dairy.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Oh, Mother, Mother!"" said Mittens--"
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful enormous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!"" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""A rolling-pin?"" said Ribby."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?"""
the-roly-poly-pudding,Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again.
the-roly-poly-pudding,Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,"" said Ribby."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.
the-roly-poly-pudding,It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.
the-roly-poly-pudding,The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
the-roly-poly-pudding,So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one.
the-roly-poly-pudding,It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He climbed up, and up, and up."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
the-roly-poly-pudding,He was like a little sweep himself.
the-roly-poly-pudding,It was most confusing in the dark.
the-roly-poly-pudding,One flue seemed to lead into another.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost."
the-roly-poly-pudding,He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.
the-roly-poly-pudding,There were some mutton bones lying about--
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""This seems funny,"" said Tom Kitten."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell! It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,"" said Tom Kitten."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?"" said the rat, chattering his teeth."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,"" said poor Tom Kitten."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Anna Maria! Anna Maria!"" squeaked the rat."
the-roly-poly-pudding,There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening-- His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots."
the-roly-poly-pudding,Anna Maria did the tying.
the-roly-poly-pudding,The old rat watched her and took snuff.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Anna Maria,"" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),--""Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,"" said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""No,"" said Samuel Whiskers, ""make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Nonsense! Butter and dough,"" replied Anna Maria."
the-roly-poly-pudding,The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter."
the-roly-poly-pudding,He did not meet anybody.
the-roly-poly-pudding,He made a second journey for the rolling-pin.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest."
the-roly-poly-pudding,They did not see him.
the-roly-poly-pudding,Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws."
the-roly-poly-pudding,She did not observe Moppet.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"But his mouth was full of soot and cob-webs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance."
the-roly-poly-pudding,It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles.
the-roly-poly-pudding,It did not offer to assist him.
the-roly-poly-pudding,Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
the-roly-poly-pudding,Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?"" inquired Samuel Whiskers."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry."
the-roly-poly-pudding,She laid hold of his ears.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly."
the-roly-poly-pudding,The rats each held an end.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I fetched as much as I could carry,"" replied Anna Maria."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I do not think""--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--""I do NOT think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!"
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property,--and other people's,--and depart at once."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,"" said Anna Maria."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"""I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney."""
the-roly-poly-pudding,So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!
the-roly-poly-pudding,"But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs."
the-roly-poly-pudding,The cat family had quite recovered.
the-roly-poly-pudding,They invited him to stay to dinner.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts."
the-roly-poly-pudding,They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like mine."
the-roly-poly-pudding,They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
the-roly-poly-pudding,Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
the-roly-poly-pudding,Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage."
the-roly-poly-pudding,I am sure _
the-roly-poly-pudding,I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow!
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!"
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags."
the-roly-poly-pudding,And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children and grand-children and great great grand-children.
the-roly-poly-pudding,There is no end to them!
the-roly-poly-pudding,Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably."
the-roly-poly-pudding,"They hang up the rats' tails in a row or the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them."
the-roly-poly-pudding,But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than-- A Mouse.
