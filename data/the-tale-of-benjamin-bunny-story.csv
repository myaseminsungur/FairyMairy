the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,ONE morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"AS soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"THAT wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest sandiest hole of all, cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what WE call lavender)."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,LITTLE Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,PETER was sitting by himself.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"""Peter,""--said little Benjamin, in a whisper--""who has got your clothes?"""
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"PETER replied--""The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,"" and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin, and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,PETER said he hoped that it would rain.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"At this point, old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling--""Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"""
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"THEY went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"LITTLE Benjamin said, ""It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in, is to climb down a pear tree."""
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,IT had been sown with lettuces.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"They left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"LITTLE Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket handkerchief."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,They took them off the scarecrow.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Benjamin tried on the tam-o-shanter, but it was too big for him."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"THEN he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"BENJAMIN, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,The lettuces certainly were very fine.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,PETER did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,Presently he dropped half the onions.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"LITTLE Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree, with a load of vegetables."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny red-brick wall."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"The mice sat on their door-steps cracking cherry-stones, they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,PRESENTLY Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"THEY got amongst flower-pots, and frames and tubs; Peter heard noises worse than ever, his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!"
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"He was a step or two in front of his cousin, when he suddenly stopped."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,THIS is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket...."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"THE cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,SHE sat there for FIVE HOURS.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"AT length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,He was looking for his son.v
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,OLD Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house, scratching off a handful of fur."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"WHEN old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked the door."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,Then he took out his nephew Peter.
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"THEN he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several things which perplexed him."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little!
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the green-house, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"WHEN Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat."
the-tale-of-benjamin-bunny,"Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the rabbit-tobacco."
