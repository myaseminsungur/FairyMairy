the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Sally Henny-penny, has YOU found three pocket-handkins?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking-- ""I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a VERY small person.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Lucie ran on, and on."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,THE path ended under a big rock.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,But there was something else--a door!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing-- ""Lily-white and clean, oh! With little frills between, oh! Smooth and hot--red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"LUCIE, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"A little frightened voice called out ""Who's that?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where Lucie had yellow curls--that little person had PRICKLES!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""WHO are you?"" said Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"The little person made a bob-curtsey--""Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""WHAT'S that thing?"" said Lucie--""that's not my pocket-handkin?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse--""That isn't my pinny?"" said Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,MRS.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!"" cried Lucie--""and there's my pinny!"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh that IS lovely!"" said Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""WHY, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell."""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""There's another one of mine,"" said Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""WHAT are those funny little white things?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself."""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""There's my last pocket-handkin!"" said Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?"" said Lucie."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."""
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Will their jackets take off?"" asked Lucy."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"""Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're ALWAYS marked at washing!"" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIR-PINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle."
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say ""Good-night,"" and to thank the washer-woman--"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,But what a VERY odd thing!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap?
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,and her shawl?
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,and her gown--and her petticoat?
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,AND how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with PRICKLES!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,Why!
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,"(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?"
the-tale-of-mrs.-tiggy-winkle,And besides--_I_ have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-wivnkle!)
