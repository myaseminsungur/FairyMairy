the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"""NOW, my dears,"" said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, ""you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."""
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"""NOW run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out."""
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"THEN old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, to the baker's."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"FLOPSY, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries; BUT Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden and squeezed under the gate!"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"FIRST he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; AND then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"BUT round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"MR. McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, ""Stop thief!"""
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"PETER was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"AFTER losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"PETER gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"MR. McGREGOR came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"AND rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"MR. McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"Presently Peter sneezed--""Kertyschoo!"""
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, AND tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,He went back to his work.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"PETER sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"HE found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,She only shook her head at him.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,Peter began to cry.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"A white cat was staring at some gold-fish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"HE went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,MR. McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes."
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!"
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"""One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."""
the-tale-of-peter-rabbit,"BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries, for supper."
