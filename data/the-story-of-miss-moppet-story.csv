the-story-of-miss-moppet,"THIS is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!"
the-story-of-miss-moppet,"THIS is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet."
the-story-of-miss-moppet,He is not afraid of a kitten.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,THIS is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,SHE thinks it is a very hard cupboard!
the-story-of-miss-moppet,THE Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,"MISS MOPPET ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire."
the-story-of-miss-moppet,THE Mouse thinks she is looking very ill.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,He comes sliding down the bell-pull.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,MISS MOPPET looks worse and worse.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,The Mouse comes a little nearer.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,"MISS MOPPET holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a hole in the duster."
the-story-of-miss-moppet,The Mouse comes VERY close.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,AND then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
the-story-of-miss-moppet,AND because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.
the-story-of-miss-moppet,"SHE ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball."
the-story-of-miss-moppet,BUT she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it--there was no Mouse!
the-story-of-miss-moppet,HE has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!
