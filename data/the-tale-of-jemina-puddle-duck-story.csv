the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"WHAT a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen! --Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"HER sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--""I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let them go cold; you know you would!"""
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,"" quacked Jemima Puddle-duck."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,SHE tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,SHE set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"WHEN she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was not much in the habit of flying.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,SHE flew beautifully when she had got a good start.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"JEMIMA alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""Quack?"" said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--""Quack?"""
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"THE gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima-- ""Madam, have you lost your way?"" said he."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""AH! is that so? indeed!"" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"He folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""Indeed! how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would teach it to mind its own business!"""
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""BUT as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit there as long as you like,"" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""THIS is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient,"" said the hospitable gentleman."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,THE shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"WHEN she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,They were greeny white and very large.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--""and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,"" said the conscientious Jemima."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""MADAM, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!"""
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff-lard for the omelette,"" said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"AND she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, ""What are you doing with those onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"""
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"HE asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"Then he went out, and trotted down the village."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"HE was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"""Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!"""
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He was rather abrupt.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"She felt surprised, and uncomfortable."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,WHILE she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima became much alarmed.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"A MOMENT afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"PRESENTLY Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima Puddle-duck."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,"SHE laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched."
the-tale-of-jemina-puddle-duck,Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.
